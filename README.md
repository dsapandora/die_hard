# THE CHALLENGE: DON’T CRASH MY DRONE
AERONAUTICS

Create an app that will enable small drone operators to know more about specific weather parameters, local terrain and no fly zones within a five-mile radius of their GPS location.

# EXPLANATION

The idea behind this project is give to the drone pilot and advance flight assistance system (AFAS). With a 3T Architecture, the DRONE and phone sync their information. Allowing to know where the drone is in the map, the weather information, the wind and precipitation also, given them advice about the warning and prohibited flight zone.
The system is based in the ROS Architecture, and Python Flask RestApi, and Android Application.
DIE (Drone Interactive Enviroment )HARD, also send control commands to the drone in case that is too far from the pilot. Allowing him to escape from mountains, forest, buildings and allowing him to land safety.
And you can check the app: http://104.236.255.81/diehard.html
