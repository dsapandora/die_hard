We are deprecating the "Don't Fly Drones Here" project because we don't have the time needed to keep the map up to date, and we don't want outdated information to look authoritative. Looks like the best sites for information on where it's safe to fly your drone is: http://knowbeforeyoufly.org/air-space-map/ and the B4 U Fly apps https://www.faa.gov/uas/b4ufly/.
